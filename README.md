MTSU project that uses networking to connect a client to a server

How to connect the client to the server:
- Access the Client.java file
- Go to line 69 and change the 6789 port to an open port on your pc
- Access the Server.java file
- Go to line 45 and make the 6789 port number to the same open port you had for step 6.
- Access the ClientTest.java file
- Change line 9 to the client's IPv4 address
- Run the clientTest.java and the ServerTest.java files

After running these steps, the client should be able to join the server.
